This game is released as an open source under CC BY-SA license. I'm developing it as practice for the [https://js13kgames.com/] competition. It has been developed using Claude 4 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro, although the music track (also CC BY-SA in case that needs explicit license) was done without AI input, just as my experimentation with the Sonnet-x system.
